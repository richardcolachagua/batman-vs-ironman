However, while working on the missile, Stark was secretly building an armored suit to escape with the help of his fellow captive, Ho Yinsen. Stark put the suit on and escaped the compound but was forced to leave without Yinsen, who died of fatal gunshot wounds buying time for Stark to power up the armor. Once Stark exited the cave, he used the suits flamethrowers to destroy the Ten Rings stockpile of his own Stark Industries weapons. While setting the camp ablaze the suit suffered damage from enemy gunfire, causing some of the suits systems to malfunction or fail. With the suit nearing failure, Stark then used the suits rudimentary rocket thrusters to escape the enemy camp just before the weapons detonated.',
