              Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark is a billionaire industrialist, a
              founding member of the Avengers, and the former CEO of Stark
              Industries. A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark is
              self-described as a genius, billionaire, playboy, and
              philanthropist. With his great wealth and exceptional technical
              knowledge, Stark was one of the world's most powerful men
              following the deaths of his parents and enjoyed the playboy
              lifestyle for many years until he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings
              in Afghanistan. With his life on the line, Stark created an
              armored suit which he used to escape. Afterward, he publicly
              revealed himself as Iron Man.
